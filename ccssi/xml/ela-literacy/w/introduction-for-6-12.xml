  <title>Introduction for 6-12</title>
  <content>&lt;p&gt;The following standards for grades 6-12 offer a focus for instruction each year to help ensure that students gain adequate mastery of a range of skills and applications. Each year in their writing, students should demonstrate increasing sophistication in all aspects of language use, from vocabulary and syntax to the development and organization of ideas, and they should address increasingly demanding content and sources. &lt;em&gt;Students advancing through the grades are expected to meet each year's grade-specific standards and retain or further develop skills and understandings mastered in preceding grades.&lt;/em&gt; The expected growth in student writing ability is reflected both in the standards themselves and in the collection of annotated student writing samples in Appendix C.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
