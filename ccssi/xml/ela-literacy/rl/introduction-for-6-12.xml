  <content>&lt;p&gt;The following standards offer a focus for instruction each year and help ensure that students gain adequate exposure to a range of texts and tasks. Rigor is also infused through the requirement that students read increasingly complex texts through the grades. Students advancing through the grades are expected to meet each year's grade-specific standards and retain or further develop skills and understandings mastered in preceding grades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CCR anchor standards and high school grade-specific standards work in tandem to define college and career readiness expectations&amp;mdash;the former providing broad standards, the latter providing additional specificity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
